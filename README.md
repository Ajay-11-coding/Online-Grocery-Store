-> This Project is created to mimic an online grocery store setting. 
-> It has multiple admins and multiple users.
-> The admin is capable of performing CRUD operations on the sections and products.
-> The user is capable of using the search function to filter relevant products and adding them to the cart to buy. 
-> The user will also be able to edit the quantity of the product in the cart. 
-> He/she can add multiple products to the cart across various sections.

-> This entire Grocery store simulation is also emulated by using API's for performing CRUD operations on sections and products.
